# RandomWalkGCN
For practical examples, run read_nel.ipynb, followed by train_GCN_fMRI.ipynb. You need to have a directory named output.
For simulated examples, run gen_graphs_SBM.py, followed by train_GCN.ipynb. You need to have a directory named output.
weight_decay = 0.01 (L2 regularization) has been added to both the examples.
